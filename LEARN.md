## How to Play

Wordino is a word puzzle game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. After each guess, the color of the letters changes to show how close you are to the correct word:

- **Green**: The letter is in the correct position.
- **Yellow**: The letter is correct but in the wrong position.
- **Gray**: The letter is not part of the word at all.

The game resets daily, providing a new word each day for everyone.

- **/app** - Contains the Android application code.
- **/docs** - Documentation files and additional resources.
- **/tests** - Unit and integration tests for the application.
